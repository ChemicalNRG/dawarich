# Docker installation

> To do that you need previously install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system.

To quick Dawarich install run Docker-compose from project root folder
```shell
docker-compose up
```
This command use [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) to build your local environment.

When this command done successfully and all services in containers will start you can open Dawarich web UI by this link [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).
